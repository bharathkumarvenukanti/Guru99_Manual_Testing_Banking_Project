# Guru99 Software Testing Project:

## Testing the Banking Facility of Guru99 Bank

* The testing process consists of four main parts:
# 1. Requirement Gathering
This process is the initial phase of the project, and it involves converting the SRS document(Received from Guru99 ) into a table with all the modules and their functionalities associated with each of the two roles, in addition to the technical requirements and functional validations.

There are two main roles in the system:

### Manager role:
Has access to all the modules.

### Customer role: 
Accesses only some features of the system.
## System Chart:
Use Creately to create an overall system chart(From Guru99):

## 2. Unit Testing
Testing modules associated with the Manager role.

- Test cases are in the file "TestCaseSuite".
- This mainly focuses on validating each input field required in each module.
- In the Project Objectives sent by Guru99, only some modules are required to be tested: 
 - New Customer,
 - Edit Customer,
 - New Account,
 - Edit Account,
 - Delete Account,
 - Delete Customer,
 - Mini Statement,
